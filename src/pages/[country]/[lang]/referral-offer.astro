                    To qualify for the Reward, you must make your first international money transfer using Jingle Pay's
                    remittance marketplace. After successfully completing your international money transfer to the
                    provided destination, 20AED will be credited to your Jingle Pay account within 15 days. Should your
                    money transfer fail for any reason, you will not qualify for receiving the 20AED reward. This reward
                    is limited to your first (1) international money transfer only.
