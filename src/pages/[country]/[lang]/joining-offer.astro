                  <p class='leading-relaxed'>
                    To qualify for the Reward, you must download the Jingle Pay application and complete your
                    onboarding/sign-up process. After completing your sign-up, 30 AED will be sent to your Jingle Pay
                    account within 15 days. Should you not qualify for completing the onboarding/sign-up process for any
                    reason, you will not qualify for receiving the 30 AED reward. The reward is limited to the first
                    3000 customers within the Offer Period; Rewards will no longer be available once the limit is
                    reached. Given you can only sign-up once, there is a limit of one (1) reward per Jingle Pay account.

                    Jingle Pay may provide an alternate reward of equal value if it is unable for any reason to fulfill
                    the Reward. Jingle Pay reserves the right to cancel, suspend or modify this offer in part or in its
                    entirety at any time without notice, for any reason in its sole discretion. Similar offers may run
                    at the same time; qualification for this offer does not constitute qualification for any other
                    offer. Jingle Pay is not responsible and/or liable if any e-mail, Reward, or offer-related materials
                    or correspondence are lost, fraudulent, abusive, stolen, late, incomplete, illegible, interrupted,
                    delayed, altered, defective, misdirected, tampered with, or irregular in any way or if any

                    deleted, or is changed without participant giving prior written notice to Jingle Pay. Jingle Pay is
                    not responsible and/or liable if a user does not receive an award because they do not qualify for a
                    Jingle Pay account (in line with our regulatory bodies). Jingle Pay reserves the right to review any
                    account related to this offer, in its sole discretion, without notice, and delay or reverse
                    completing of the Reward. An offer is void when an account is prohibited, fraudulent, abusive, not
                    completed through legitimate channels or irregular in any way. Any questions relating to the offer
                    will be resolved in Jingle Pay's sole discretion and its decisions related to the offer will be
