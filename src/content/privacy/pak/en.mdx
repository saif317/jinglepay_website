## <a id="about-policy"></a>1. ABOUT THIS POLICY

We, Jingle Pay Limited (“JPL”), take your privacy very seriously. Please read this privacy policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are and how and why we collect, store, use and share your personal data when you use this website at https://jinglepay.com/ or otherwise when we collect personal data from you such as if you use our app, or call or email us. It also explains your rights in relation to your personal data and how to contact us or supervisory authorities in the event you have a complaint.

We collect, use and are responsible for certain personal data about you. When we do so we are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in the UAE as well as DIFC.

JPL is the data ‘controller’ of that personal data for the purposes of those laws. Our full details are set out at the end of this policy.

### Your obligations

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.

If you provide us with information about any other person, for example any other individuals you may have a joint bank account with, then you must ensure that you have their consent to pass those details to us and for us to use those details in accordance with this privacy policy. You should also make sure that you bring this privacy policy to their attention.
