We may use your personal data to send you updates (by email, text message, telephone or post) about our products and/or services, including exclusive offers, promotions or new products and/or services.

We have a legitimate interest in using your personal data for marketing purposes (see above â€˜How and why we use your personal dataâ€™). This means we do not usually need your consent to send you marketing information. However, where consent is needed, we will ask for this consent separately and clearly.

We will always treat your personal data with the utmost respect and never sell it to other organisations for marketing purposes.

Email, text message and any other marketing messages we send may contain tracking beacons / tracked clickable links or similar server technologies in order to track subscriber activity within email marketing messages. Where used, such marketing messages may record a range of subscriber data relating to engagement, geographic, demographics and already stored subscriber data.

## 7. Who we share your personal data with <a id="data-sharing"></a>

We routinely share personal data with:

- companies within the Jingle Pay group;
- third parties we use to help deliver our products and/or services to you, e.g. payment service providers, and providers of identity and screening checks. Our identity and screening checks (known as KYC and AML checks) are outsourced to our KYC partner;

- third parties approved by you, e.g. social media sites you choose to link your account to or third-party payment providers;
- credit reference agencies;
- our bank;
- money exchange companies.

We only allow our service providers to handle your personal data if we are satisfied they take appropriate measures to protect your personal data. We also impose contractual obligations on service providers to ensure they can only use your personal data to provide services to us and to you.

We may also need to:

- share personal data with external auditors, e.g. in relation to ISO or Investors in People accreditation and the audit of our accounts;
- disclose and exchange information with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or
- share some personal data with other parties, such as potential buyers of some or all of our business or during a restructuring. Usually, information will be anonymised but this may not always be possible; however, the recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.

## 8. Third-party links <a id="third-party-links-privacy"></a>

This website may include links to third-party websites. Clicking on those links may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy policies. You should read any policies and other statements on such websites carefully.

## 9. Where your personal data is held <a id="data-storage"></a>

Personal data may be held at our offices and those of our group companies, third-party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described above (see above: â€˜Who we share your personal data withâ€™).

Some of these third parties may be based outside the UAE. For more information, including on how we safeguard your personal data when this happens, see below: â€˜Transferring your personal data out of the UAEâ€™.

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know it. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## 10. How long your personal data will be kept <a id="data-retention"></a>

We will keep your personal data while you have an account with us or we are providing products and/or services to you. Thereafter, we will keep your personal data for as long as is necessary:

- to respond to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your behalf;
- to show that we treated you fairly;
- to keep records required by law.

To determine how long we should keep the different types of personal data we hold about you, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We will not keep your personal data for longer than necessary.

In some circumstances, we may anonymise personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 11. Transferring your personal data out of the UAE <a id="data-transfer-outside-uae"></a>

We will keep your personal data while you have an account with us or we are providing products and/or services to you. Thereafter, we will keep your personal data for as long as is necessary:

- with our offices or other companies within our group located outside the UAE;
- with your and our service providers located outside the UAE;
- if you are based outside the UAE;

Under data protection law, we can only transfer your personal data to a country or international organisation outside the UAE where allowed by the law.

### Transfers with appropriate safeguards

Where there is no adequacy decision, we may transfer your personal data to another country or international organisation if we are satisfied the transfer complies with data protection law, appropriate safeguards are in place, and enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects.

### Transfers under an exception

In the absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, we may transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation where an exception applies under relevant data protection law, e.g.:

- you have explicitly consented to the proposed transfer after having been informed of the possible risks;
- the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between us or to take pre-contract measures at your request;
- the transfer is necessary for a contract in your interests, between us and another person; or
- the transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

We may also transfer information for the purpose of our compelling legitimate interests, so long as those interests are not overridden by your interests, rights and freedoms. Specific conditions apply to such transfers and we will provide relevant information if and when we seek to transfer your personal data on this ground.
