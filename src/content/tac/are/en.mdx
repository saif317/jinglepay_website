## <a id="using-the-account"></a>5. Using the Account

<ol class="alpha-list">
<li>Permitted transactions - to the extent permitted by law, you may use your Account and Card to make payments to Merchants or withdraw cash at ATMs who/which accept the Card, or online, subject to the availability of sufficient Available Balance and to the limits we set. You may also make peer to peer transfers within the Jingle Pay ecosystem, or get cash back from certain Merchants who provide this service. The Card must not be used for illegal purposes.</li>

<li>
  Authorization - You will be asked to confirm transactions on the Mobile Application. Your transaction will be
  authorized once you confirm it on the Mobile Application. In case of a point-of-sale transaction, you can authorize
  the transaction by entering your PIN or signing the receipt. You cannot stop a transaction after it has been
  transmitted to us by giving your authorization.
</li>

<li>
  Refused Transactions - In certain circumstances, we may refuse to authorize a transaction including but not limited
  to:
  <ol class='alpha-list'>
    <li>If we have reasonable concerns about the security of your Card or Account.</li>
    <li>If we reasonably suspect your Card is being used in a fraudulent or unauthorised manner.</li>
    <li>
      If we need to do so to comply with the law of any jurisdiction or if we believe that the transaction may be
      contrary to law.
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are insufficient Available Funds to cover the transaction and all associated fees at the time that we
      receive notification of the transaction.
    </li>
    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe that you are acting in breach of this Agreement.</li>
    <li>
      If there are errors, failures (mechanical or otherwise) or refusals by retailers, payment processors or payment
      schemes processing transactions.
    </li>
    <li>If regulatory or legal reasons prevent us from processing the transaction.</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li>
  We are not liable if a Merchant refuses to accept your Card, ATM cannot dispense money or cannot fully/partially
  complete a transaction for any reason. If your transaction fails to complete properly, for instance due to a lost
  internet connection or Mobile Application error, you must check your transaction history to confirm if your
  transaction was successful before attempting it again. Repeated attempts may lead to duplicate transactions, for which
  we are not liable.
</li>

<li>
  We may suspend, restrict, or cancel your account without notice if we suspect unauthorized/fraudulent use, or if you
  breach these Terms.
</li>

<li>You shall be liable for all transactions made using your Account or Card.</li>
</ol>
