JPL have outsourced some of its activities to a third party service provider that uses screen scraping techniques to extract personal information from Emirates ID ('EID') or other Personal Identification Document ('PID') for the purpose of client onboarding. Although JPL make sure that the data retrieved from identification document must be handled carefully and without any error, the process may involve certain risks that are listed hereunder:
• Data Accuracy: Scraping identification data may result in inaccuracies or errors. This can lead to issues such as mistaken identity or incorrect personal information being used for decision-making purposes
• Security Vulnerabilities: The process of scraping data may involve accessing databases or systems where the information is stored. Any vulnerabilities in these systems could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Though the risks listed above are very minimal however JPL has implemented several controls to ensure accuracy and security of customer's data.
