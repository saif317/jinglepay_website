## <a id="third-party-links"></a>24. Third Party Links

Links to third-party websites on the Mobile Application are provided solely for your convenience. If you use these links, you leave the Mobile Application. We have not reviewed any of these third-party websites and do not control and are not responsible for these websites or their content (including their terms and conditions) or availability. We, therefore, do not endorse or make any representations about them, any material found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to the Mobile Application, you do so entirely at your own risk.

Jingle Pay Limited is integrated with a Partner's website or application (Lean Technologies or any other partner Jingle Pay Limited may integrate for the provision of services) that you wish to use. The following services are included:

**Payment Initiation Services:** We provide regulated payment initiation services ("PIS"). With your consent, and at your instruction, we instruct the payment account provider (e.g., your bank or credit card issuer) ("Payment Account Provider") to make a payment or payments from your selected payment account (your "Payment Account") to your chosen recipient. When you want to make a payment using PIS, we will redirect you to your Payment Account Provider so you can provide them with your login and security credentials ("Credentials") and undergo authentication with them. We will never ask you to share your Credentials with us. The Payment Account Provider will only act on the instruction to make the payment after you give them your Credentials and successfully authenticate with them.

**Account Information Services:** We provide regulated account information services ("AIS"), including through our Partners. We enable you to:

- access and view information relating to your Payment Accounts ("Account Information"), through our mobile app in a consolidated form; and
- where relevant, to share that Account Information with those Partners and other third parties.
