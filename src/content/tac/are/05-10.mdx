## <a id="using-the-account"></a>5. Using the Account, including the Card and Wallet

a) You may only use the Account in accordance with the Agreement and we have the right to restrict the services/facilities provided pursuant to the issue/usage of the account at our sole discretion and terms.

b) Subject to sufficient Available Funds and any restrictions in the Agreement, the Card can be used worldwide at POS Terminals or E-commerce website, or any card-operated machine or device, whether belonging to us or other participating banks or financial institutions where logos appear on the Card are displayed/ accepted and any other services so authorized on the Card by us. The Card may also be used at any Merchant location that accepts the Transaction for processing or displays the logo appearing on the Card. The Card may be used for retail purchases, purchases of goods and services approved by us or provided for transaction values not exceeding the Limit (subject always to sufficient Available Funds) from time to time.

c) The Available Funds will be reduced by the full amount of each Transaction plus any applicable Charges.

d) Due to restrictions, the Card may not operate in some countries and may not be accepted at some Merchant locations which are not in compliance with either our internal policies or other requirements as determined at our sole discretion.

e) Merchants that accept the Card are required to seek authorization from us or through any appointed payment processor for all Transactions that you make, and we cannot stop a transaction once authorized. Some Merchants may not be able to authorize your Transaction if they cannot obtain an online authorization from us.

f) We do not recommend using the Card as: (i) a guarantee of payment, for example as a deposit for hotels, cruise lines or car rental, as Merchants such as these may estimate the final bill and this amount will be temporarily unavailable to access or spend; or as (ii) an arrangement for periodic billing, as any debits to the Card as a result of such arrangements will be considered to have been authorized by you.

g) The Card is only for your use and expires on the date on the front of the Card or displayed on the digital version of the card in the application and may be extended for a limited period subject to the terms of the User Guide.

h) The Card may also expire before the expiry date or validity period as mentioned on the digital or physical Card if it is not used for any Transaction within the specified period. Your Card may be subject to a periodic fee which will be applied in accordance with the Schedule of Charges[1]. Unless otherwise specified the periodic fee will apply regardless of if the balance of the Card is zero (0) unless you have used your Card for loads, reloads or transactions during the specified period. The periodic fees shall be deducted from the Available Funds and for the avoidance of doubt will apply regardless of whether the Card has been used for Transactions.

i) You agree not to use the Card in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Card. You also agree not to use the Card for accessing or purchasing goods from adult or gambling locations or internet sites, or for any other unlawful activity.

j) You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including any foreign exchange controls) in respect of the Card in the UAE and the country of use. We reserve the right to suspend the Card, freeze the available balance on the Card, terminate the Agreement and exercise any other remedies available to us, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, due to your failure to comply with any part of this provision. You agree that we have no obligation to monitor, review or evaluate the legality of your Transactions and that such actions shall be your sole responsibility. We are not liable for any prohibited use or misuse of the Card whatsoever.

k) The Card can only be used if there are sufficient Available Funds for an intended Transaction. If, for any reason whatsoever, an intended Transaction causes the Card to be debited in excess of the Available Funds (whether by use of the Card or towards any fees or charges), we have the sole discretion to approve or reject the Transaction. If such Transaction is approved, you shall be responsible for immediately compensating us for the Shortfall. A Shortfall fee may be payable in the event a Shortfall rises.

l) We are entitled to set off any sum of money on the Account due from you to us against any positive balance on any other card or linked bank account held by you with us.

m) Any usage of the Account inconsistent or in contravention with the usage described in the Agreement is not permitted.

n) If you are entitled to a refund for goods or services purchased using the Card for any other reason, such refund will be made to the Account, in the applicable currency thereby increasing the Available Funds.

o) Our record of any Transaction shall be final and binding. You will not be provided with a printed statement and can check your Available Funds. You may also be able to make a balance enquiry through the Mobile Application. It is your responsibility to keep track of the Available Funds. You acknowledge that the amount stated on the printed slip or digital receipt advice shall not for any purpose whatsoever be taken as a conclusive or up-to-date statement of the Account.

p) You acknowledge that the available balance in the Account may be different from the balance amount as displayed through any channel, due to pending Transactions or other blocked amounts (being amounts transacted but not processed) relevant to the Card.
